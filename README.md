Design and Performance Analysis of high gain, Low-power Two stage CMOS Opamp
# Overview of Folded Cascode
The two-stage folded cascode operational amplifier is a widely used architecture in analog circuit design, combining high gain, wide bandwidth, and low power consumption. The first stage, a folded cascode, enhances gain and input common-mode range by “folding” the signal path, allowing both NMOS and PMOS transistors to operate effectively even under low supply voltages. The second stage, typically a common-source amplifier, provides additional gain and output drive capability. This topology achieves excellent stability, slew rate, and common-mode rejection, while maintaining low distortion and good linearity. Due to its balanced trade-off between performance and efficiency, it is well-suited for high-speed, low-voltage, and precision analog applications such as data converters, filters, and sensor interfaces.
